# Vue 3 + Vite + Storybook

This is a project template that combines Vite, Vue, and Storybook to provide a starting point for building modern web applications with Vue.js. It aims to streamline the development process and facilitate component-driven development using Storybook.

## Features

- [**Vite**](https://vitejs.dev/): The project is built on the Vite build tool, offering fast and efficient development with hot module replacement (HMR) and blazing-fast build times.
- [**Vue**](https://vuejs.org/): Vue.js is the core framework used for building reactive and dynamic user interfaces. It provides a powerful and intuitive way to structure and manage your application's components.
- [**Storybook**](https://storybook.js.org/): Storybook is a development environment for designing, building, and testing UI components in isolation. It allows you to develop components independently and showcase them in an interactive UI documentation.

## Getting Started: From Scratch with Vite, Vue, and Storybook

Follow these steps to set up a project template with Vite, Vue, and Storybook:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed:
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn

### 1. Initialize a new project

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. Run the following command to initialize a new Vite project:
```shell
npm init vite@latest
# or
yarn create vite
```
This will prompt you to select a project template. Choose the vue template when prompted.

### 2. Install dependencies

Navigate into the newly created project directory:
```shell
cd your-project-name
```
```shell
npm install
# or
yarn
```

### 3. Add Storybook

To add Storybook to your project, run the following command:
```shell
npx storybook@latest init
```
This command will set up Storybook in your project, creating the necessary configuration files and folder structure.

### 4. Start the development server

To start the Vite development server, run the following command:
```shell
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
This will launch your Vue application in your default browser. You can begin developing your Vue components in the src directory.

###  5. Launch Storybook

To start Storybook, run the following command:
```shell
npm run storybook
# or
yarn storybook
```
This will open Storybook in your default browser, allowing you to view and interact with your Vue components in an isolated environment. You can develop and document your components in the src/stories directory.

### 6. Build your project

When you're ready to build your project for production, run the following command:
```shell
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```
This will create an optimized and minified version of your Vue application in the dist directory.

### 7. Customize and expand

You now have a basic setup with Vite, Vue, and Storybook. Feel free to customize and expand the project according to your needs. Add your own components, styles, and functionality, and explore the capabilities of Vite, Vue, and Storybook to create powerful web applications.


## Getting Started: Clone and Build

1. **Clone the repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the command `git clone <repository-url>`.

2. **Install dependencies**: Navigate to the project's root directory and run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the necessary dependencies.

3. **Run the development server**: Start the development server by running `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`. This will launch the application in your default browser.

4. **Explore the components**: Open Storybook by running `npm run storybook` or `yarn storybook` in a separate terminal window. This will open a browser window with Storybook, allowing you to browse and interact with the available components.
